## Project Overview

### The Challenge
Urban Heat Islands (UHI) represent one of the most significant anthropogenic modifications to local climate, with profound implications for public health, energy consumption, and urban resilience. The **GenHack 4** challenge focused on analyzing and correcting systematic biases in ERA5-Land reanalysis data when applied to urban environments, using Madrid, Spain as a primary case study.

### Core Problem
ERA5 reanalysis data, while comprehensive and globally consistent, systematically overestimates temperatures in urban areas due to its inability to resolve fine-scale urban processes. This bias amplifies during heatwaves, creating significant errors for climate adaptation planning and heat-health warning systems.

## Our Unique Approach

### Three-Pillar Methodology

#### 1. **Comprehensive Urban Climate Analysis**
- **Multi-source data integration**: ERA5-Land, ECA&D station data, Sentinel-2 NDVI, WUDAPT LCZ classifications
- **Dual UHI quantification methods**: LCZ-based (primary) and distance-based (fallback) approaches
- **Temporal analysis**: 2020-2025 period with daily resolution
- **Validation suite**: 12+ statistical metrics including temperature-regime specific biases

#### 2. **Machine Learning Ensemble Framework**
We developed a **four-model ensemble** specifically designed to address different aspects of urban climate modeling:

| Model | Purpose | Key Innovation |
|-------|---------|----------------|
| **XGBoost Bias Correction** | Corrects systematic ERA5 biases | Nonlinear, feature-dependent correction |
| **Random Forest UHI Prediction** | Predicts UHI intensity directly | Exceptional generalization (0.009 R² gap) |
| **Ridge Regression Downscaling** | Statistical downscaling of ERA5 | Interpretable coefficients for physical understanding |
| **Quantile Regression** | Uncertainty quantification | Full prediction intervals for risk assessment |

#### 3. **Interactive Visualization Platform**
- **Full-stack Flask API** with comprehensive endpoints
- **Real-time multi-city analysis** with KNN clustering
- **Dynamic visualization system** supporting 10+ chart types
- **Downloadable data and metrics** for reproducibility

## Key Scientific Findings

### Madrid's Urban Climate Signature (2020-2025)

#### Temperature Validation Results
- **Maximum Temperature (TX)**: Excellent agreement with ERA5 (R²=0.992, bias=+0.34°C)
- **Minimum Temperature (TN)**: Significant warm bias (+1.95°C), amplified during heatwaves (+2.99°C)
- **Nocturnal UHI Intensity**: Mean = 2.25°C, extreme events up to 7.76°C

#### Climate Extremes Profile
- **Heatwaves**: 30 events/year, average duration 7.8 days, maximum 43 days
- **Cold spells**: 19 events/year, urban moderation effect evident
- **Precipitation extremes**: 99th percentile threshold = 17.82 mm/day

#### Environmental Relationships
- **NDVI cooling elasticity**: -16.52°C per NDVI unit (strong theoretical cooling potential)
- **Wind-temperature correlation**: Weak (-0.12), suggesting radiative processes dominate
- **Pressure-temperature relationship**: Strong (-0.33 to -0.39), indicating synoptic control
